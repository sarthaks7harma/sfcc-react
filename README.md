# Speech to Text using WEB SPEECH API

The Web Speech API aims to enable web developers to provide, in a web browser, speech-input and text-to-speech output features that are typically not available when using standard speech-recognition or screen-reader software. The API itself is agnostic of the underlying speech recognition and synthesis implementation and can support both server-based and client-based/embedded recognition and synthesis. The API is designed to enable both brief (one-shot) speech input and continuous speech input. Speech recognition results are provided to the web page as a list of hypotheses, along with other relevant information for each hypothesis.
